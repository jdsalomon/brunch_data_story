				<h1>The journey behind a typical hipster sunday hangover brunch</h1>
				<p>Imagine sitting on the terrace of a Parisian café on Sunday morning before ending the weekend and going back to work, a coffee with a cigarette and an avocado toast in hand <em> - typical hipster routine </em>. <br /> Where could your arabica coffee come from ? Why is it that avocado toasts can be found anywhere now, compared to last decade ? Has the cost of the flour of your bread always been the same ? Where do you think your cigarette has been produced ?
					</p>
				<p>The difficulty of knowing the actual story behind what we consume is the topic that interests us. We will show how factors such as globalization, economical crises, or social trends can indirectly influence the products we consume and their price, by focusing on four crops : wheat, avocados, coffee and tobacco.

				<p>One can see that the production of most crops parent categories increased from the 1960’s until now. This trend was clearly expected because the population has increased as well. In 1961 there were 3’091 million human beings and in 2016 the number has doubled to reach 7’464 mio [<a href="#ref:WorldPop">1</a>]. </p>
				<p>We can observe that an increase in the world population requires a higher food production in order to satisfy needs. Generally in many populations we’ve seen the income increasing and many people left the poverty state. According to the world bank, nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme proverty (with less than 1.9$ a day) in 2015 than in 1990 [<a href="#ref:Poverty">2</a>]. With the increasing income, the diets will generally change, people will prefer high-value foods (such as livestock products) as opposed to starchy food (such as wheat). So the world production is facing two challenges : producing in quantities that has never been that high, and continuously adapting to produce the right kind of crops. </p>

				<p>This graphs illustrates how the demand for crops changed over time. Most of the categories such as coffee, cocoa, and raw materials, rubber for example increased far more than the world population or cereals. Also, except tobacco and vegetable textile fibers, the relative increase in the production of other crops was greater than the increase in the world population.</p>
				<p>Rubber is a raw material used in the manufacturing of many derived products, the most known being tyres. With 127 million vehicles on the world in 1960 and 1322 mio in 2016, there is a natural increase in the demand for rubber [<a href = "#ref:MotorVeihcle">3</a>].</p>
				<P>Hence the demand for agricultural raw materials such as rubber can be related to economic growth. The advanced in fertilizers, transportation or refregiration of vegetables or fruits completely changed the way people consume food. 60 years ago, it was difficult even unconceivable to eat tomatoes in winter in Sweden after you went out to hunt for the northern lights (another typical hipster activity).  </p>

			<div class="content" align="justify">
			<p class="align-left">The price evolution of wheat : </p>
			<p>Import VPQ is larger than the export VPQ, so it’s more expensive in average to buy wheat than to sell it. Since 1961, we notice that its price fluctuated a lot and over two periods the price of this commodity increased heavily (1973-1974 and 2007-2008). </p>
			<ul>
				<li>In 1972, bad weather hit the world and for the first time in 20 years, world food production dropped. The production was reduced by 33 million tonnes at a time where the world required an extra 24 million tonnes to meet the needs of a rapidly rising population [<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>]. </li>
				<li>Two years later in 1974, the world really needed the forecasted abundant harvests in richer nations in order to refill the stocks. But bad luck hit again and Canada, USA, the former USSR and much of Asia gathered poor crops during that year because of bad weather again. Catastrophe, at the end of the year, world cereal reserves reached a 22-year low and to make it worse, the USA government banned the exportation of 10 million tonnes of grains [<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>] . All of these made the prices skyrocket.</li>

		<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
			<div class="content" align="justify">
			<p>In the meantime, the agricultural sector has witnessed great technological advances improving the productivity of the workers and reducing the cost of growing crops. The way crops are grown changed, farmers try to grow crops they can sell for the highest price to get more benefit. For example, if maize sells to higher prices on the market then producers will tend to grow more maize at the expense of other crops. Hence the supply will be reduced and their price raised. Increasing demand for livestock products requires to grow more food for them which will increase the demand and prices for cereals and oilseeds.</p>

		<!-- Wheat VPQ + Oil -->
		<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-right image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
			<div class="content" align="justify">
			<p>Wheat prices have encountered many peaks (1973-1974, 1980-1981) even more recently (2008 and 2011-2013). This makes us think of another commodity that peaked in 1973, 1980, 2008 and 2012 because of wars or financial crises. You have it : Oil !! </p>
			<p>The pearson correlation coefficient between this commodity and wheat is quite significant : 0.908 and 0.906 for respectively the wheat export and import value per quantity. </p>
			<p>One can think of many reasons which can explain the correlation between wheat and petrol. Fertilizers and chemical products are basically made of oil derivatives and they’re used to grow wheat for instance. If oil is expensive then wheat will also be expensive to produce. This factor is amplified because many developing countries also import oil. So if the oil is more expensive then they’re left with less to buy the chemicals and nutrients that requires their high-yield intensive farming.</p>

		</section>
		<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-right image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
			<div class="content" align="justify">
			<p>Another reason could be that countries experience rapid economic growth (country from emerging market economies) requires more crude oil to transport goods or to provide services. In China or in India, people change their eating habits because they have higher incomes which allow them to afford more nutritious diets, increasing their demand for agricultural products, like corn, wheat or soybeans an increasing demand for food, especially for livestock products, which generated increased cereal and oilseed demand to feed the cattle [<a href="#ref:Correlation">6</a>].</p>
			<p>Last solution could be the increase in the popularity of biofuels. They’re made from maize for example for the ethanol. Record oil prices and environmental concerns strengthened the interest in finding alternative energy sources. A list of policy measures in the United States of America and the European Union (EU) encouraged the expansion of biofuel production [<a href="#ref:biofuels">7</a>]. </p>

			<p>This map illustrates perfectly the wheat market. In red are shown the countries that import more wheat or flour than they export and in green the ones that export more. For the poor in developing countries, food can account for at least 50 percent and up to 70–80 percent of their budget. Thus, higher prices affect not only their food consumption in terms of quantity and quality, but also their spending in general. The most visible indicator of this negative impact was the social unrest and rioting that erupted around the world triggered by soaring food prices. Many of the poorest countries are food importers, heavily dependent on cereal imports. Higher food prices on world markets mean higher food import bills and a balance of payments problem</p>

			<p>Let’s have a look at the big names in the wheat market. From which country the flour in your bread is most likely to come from ? Australia, Canada, France, Russia, Ukraine and the United States of America are the ones who export wheat the much. Algeria, Brazil, Egypt Spain and Italy are the biggest importers.</p>
			<p>The general overview of a wheat market is the following : few countries with high yield, high production area flood the world with wheat. The wheat is mostly manufactured and transformed inside the countries it’s imported. Only Turkey imports significant amount of wheat and re-exports flour. Looking at China and India, their cereals import have been going downwards since 1980, by about 4 percent per year. In the early 1980 they were importing on average about 14 million tonnes per year to roughly 6 million at the beginning of this decade[<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>]. This means that the growth in cereals demand in these two countries has been met mainly from domestic sources.  </p>

				<p>Why would Germany play with coffee importation vs. exportation ? Probably because it is a profitable market ! Let’s see the value of the importation vs exportation for these top 50 countries.</p>
				<p>The plot on the right shows the import vs export value (in USD $1’000) in 2016 for the top 50 “players” in the coffee market.</p>

				<p>From our “value per quantity” measure, Germany imports green coffee beans at an average price of 2.61 (USD$/kg) and exports it back for an average price of 2.77 (USD$/kg), thus earning USD $0,16 per kilogram of sold green coffee beans and approximately USD $ 55’157’000 in 2016 ! (as they export 335K tonnes for green coffee beans). This confirms our hypothesis of “profitable market”. </p>

				<p>Actually Germany is not the only country that takes advantage from trading coffee ! We can see other countries standing out : Belgium, Italy, Switzerland for example.
				<p>Belgium earns money mainly from exportation of roasted coffee and green coffee beans. Yet, like Germany, it is not a coffee-producing country.</p>

				How much is it profitable for Switzerland ?
				<p>They import green coffee beans at an average price of 3.92 (USD$ per kg), and export roasted coffee at an average price of 31.15 (USD$ per kg), thus earning USD $27,23 per kilogram of sold roasted coffee and approximately USD $1’ 770’041’195 in 2016 !</p>

				Ignoring the (weird) products cigarettes contain, and focusing on the tobacco plant, we will show the journey of the tobacco, and illustrates the countries that profit from the highly fruitful and controversial business of cigarettes. </p>

				<h3>Top tobacco producers</h3>
				<p>Looking at the production of tobacco over time for the top 5 producers of tobacco of 2016, we clearly see that China is a main player in the tobacco production. <br/>The worldwide tobacco production peaked in 1997, where it was 2.5 times higher than in 1961. <br/>Taking out China of the equation, and the peak worldwide production is in 1993, where it was 1.5 times higher than in 1961. </p> <p>We thus expect China to be the main source of tobacco in the world.</p>

				<p>In the map, we highlighted the main actors in the tobacco/cigarettes trade business, in 2016.  <br/>From the map, we can derive some conclusions:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Tobacco is not exclusively exported by big producers. Some european countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands use it as a trade commodity: they import it cheap to sell them at a higher price: Russia, France, Paraguay, South Africa… Brazil is the number one exporter, not China as we expected. <strong>It turns out that the Chinese people seems to smoke most of its tobacco!</strong> </li>
				<li>The main importers of tobacco unmanufactured are, as expected, the European countries that export but don’t produce (Germany, Belgium), but also Russia, one the number one importer of tobacco. <strong>China also imports tobacco, they really love tobacco! </strong></li>
				<li>Most of the main importers use tobacco as a way to <strong>manufacture cigarettes</strong>. We see that Germany and Netherlands not only trade unmanufactured tobacco, but also are the main exporters of cigarettes.</li>
				<li>The main cigarettes importers are sometimes <strong>surprising</strong>: Australia is still a main importer, <a href="https://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2017/appendix-ix/en/">even with the strong taxes on cigarettes</a>. China, who we expected to have enough cigarettes, is still one of the main importers! As well Germany and Netherlands are also big cigarettes importers. They deal with tobacco at all fronts.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="align-center"> Tobacco is a global business, leaving most of North Africa out of it. <br/> Given the many actors, that all have different roles we can ask ourselves: <strong>who makes the most money trading tobacco or cigarettes?</strong> </p>

				<p>As shown in the plot on the right, we can see a good “business model”: you import tobacco cheaply, and you export cigarettes with a huge profit (remember the high value per quantity). <br/>Germany follows this model and is the country with the highest gross profit in terms of import/export of tobacco related trades. The big producers of tobacco thus make most of their money exporting it, or making cigarettes and exporting them. </p>
				<p> Strangely China is part of the countries losing the most money dealing with international tobacco trades. This is explained by the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Tobacco_Corporation">CNTC: China National Tobacco Corporation</a>, a state-owned manufacturer of tobacco products that has the monopoly of the market in China.
				<p><strong>China is the n°1 consumer of cigarettes (roughly 40% of the world’s consumption), explaining the tobacco/cigarettes concentration around this country.</strong> </p>

				<h1>What's to take away from this ?</h1>
				<p class="align-left"> Infinite analysis can be done and we don’t want to drown you in numbers, but rather to show you how complex can the food market be. </p>

				<p class="align-left"> We don't always know what we consume. Starting only with official united nation statistics, we discovered the journey of the food and the trade commodities that end up in our daily hipster brunch, supported by all the history of food. This journey takes on a world-wide range, an epic journey showing the machinery and the effect of globalization in our world.</p>
				<!-- <p class="align-left"> It is easy to hear many false stories about food concerning their ethical issues or their ecological and financial impact. <br/>Starting only with official united nation statistics, we have shown you what you are actually consuming on your daily hipster brunch on a wide-world range, supported by all the history of food during the last century.</p> -->
				<p class="align-left">Yes, your <strong>avocado</strong> is not necessarily from France, and yes it is the new green gold of south america and has ethical problems. Indeed <strong>coffee</strong> is more than a fancy product but a world wide business. And yes, <strong>cigarettes</strong> are traveling the world to be consumed aside your fancy brunch. And yes, <strong>wheat</strong> is a need that has to be farmed extensively for your french baguette, strongly related to how the world is doing. </p>
				<p>So knowing all of that, you might think in a more responsible way now. <br/>But don't worry! It is not wrong to enjoy life and having a local ethical hipster brunch from time to time! </p>
