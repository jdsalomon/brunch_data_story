				<h1>The journey behind a typical hipster sunday hangover brunch</h1>
				<p>Imagine sitting on the terrace of a Parisian café on Sunday morning before ending the weekend and going back to work, a coffee with a cigarette and an avocado toast in hand <em> - typical hipster routine </em>. <br /> Does your Arabica coffee come directly from Brazil ? Why is it that avocado toasts can be found anywhere now, compared to last decade ? Has the cost of the flour of your bread always been the same ? Where do you think your cigarette has been produced ?
					</p>
				<p>The difficulty of knowing the actual story behind what we consume is the topic that interests us. We will show how factors such as globalization, economical and ecological crises, or social tendancies can indirectly influence the products we consume and their price, by focusing on four crops : wheat, avocados, coffee and tobacco.

				<p>One can see that the production of most crops parent categories increased from the 1960’ until now. This trend was clearly expected because the population has increased as well. In 1961 there was 3’091 million human beings and in 2016 the number has doubled to reach 7’464 mio [<a href="#ref:WorldPop">1</a>]. </p>
				<p>We can observe that an increase in the world population requires a higher food production in order to satisfy needs. Generally in many populations we’ve seen the income increasing and many people left the poverty state. According to the world bank, nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme proverty (live with less than 1.9$ a day) in 2015 than in 1990 [<a href="#ref:Poverty">2</a>]. With the increasing income, the diets will generally change, people will prefer high-value foods (such as livestock products) as opposed to starchy food (such as wheat). So the world production is facing two challenges : producing in quantities that was never bigger and continuously adapt to produce the right kind of crops. </p>

				<p>This graphs illustrates how the demand for crops changed over time. Most of the categories such as coffee, cocoa, and raw materials, rubber for example increased far more than the world population or cereals. Also, except tobacco and vegetable textile fibers, the relative increase in the production of other crops was greater than the increase in the world population.</p>
				<p>Rubber is a raw materials used in the manufacturing of many derived products, the most known being tyres. With 127 million vehicles on the world in 1960 and 1322 mio in 2016, there is natural increase in the demand for rubber [<a href = "#ref:MotorVeihcle">3</a>].</p>
				<P>Hence the demand for agricultural raw materials such as rubber can be related to economic growth. The advanced in fertilizers, transportation or refregiration of vegetables or fruits totally change the way people consume food or food was available 60 years ago is not the same as today. It was difficult even unconceivable to eat tomatoes in winter in Sweden after you went out to hunt for the northern lights (another typical hipster activity).  </p>

				<p> On the scatter plot we can see the four crops in our hipster brunch. Of course they’re not found at the same location on the plot which shows where each crop of crops in products in which quantities nowadays.</p>
				<p> We can observe several categories : 
					<ul>
						<li>The cereals are cheap and produced and lot, the same for cassava or potatoes for the vegetables.</li>

				<p>Tobacco is the most expensive product of interest and he’s as produced as the coffee and avocados. On the other hand wheat is much more produced and an order of magnitude cheaper than the other crops of interest.

			<p class="align-left">The price evolution for the wheat : </p>
			<p>Import VPQ more bigger than export VPQ, so it’s more expensive in average to buy wheat than to sell it. Since 1961, we notice that it’s price fluctuated a lot and over two periods the price of this commodity increased a lot (1973-1974 and 2007-2008). </p>
			<ul>
				<li>In 1972, bad weather hit the world and for the first time 20 years world food production dropped. The production was reduced by 33 million tonnes where the world required an extra 24 million tonnes to meet the needs of a rapidly rising population [<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>]. </li>
				<li>Two years later in 1974, the world really needed the forecasted abundant harvests in richer nations in order to refill the stocks. But bad luck hit again and Canada, the USA, the former USSR and much of Asia gathered poor crops in that year because of bad weather again. Catastrophe, at the end of the year, world cereal reserves reached a 22-year low and to make it worse, the USA government banned the exportation of 10 million tonnes of grains [<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>] . All of these made the prices skyrocked.</li>

			<p>In the meantime, the agricultural sector has witnessed great technological advances improving the productivity of the workers and reducing the cost of growing crops. The way crops are grown changed also, farmers will try to grow crops which he can sell for the highest price to get more benefits. For example, if maize sell to higher prices on the market then producers will tend to grow more maize at the expense of other crops. Hence the supply will be reduced and their price raised. Increasing demand for livestock products requires to grow more food for them which will increase the demand and prices for cereals and oilseeds.</p>

			<p>Wheat prices have encountered many peaks (1973-1974, 1980-1981) and more recently (2008 and 2011-2013) Which make us think what other commodity had peaks in 1973, 1980, 2008 and 2012 because of wars or financial crises. You have it : Petrol !! </p>
			<p>The pearson correlation coefficient between this commodity and wheat is quite significant : 0.908 and 0.906 for respectively the wheat export and import value per quantity. </p>
			<p>One can thing of many reasons which can explain the correlation between wheat and petrol.Fertilizers and chemical products are basically made of oil derivatives and they’re used to grow wheat for instance. If oil is expensive then wheat will also be expensive to produce. This factor is amplified because many developing countries also import oil. So if the oil is more expensive then they’re left with less to buy the chemicals and nutrients that requires their high-yield intensive farming.</p>

		<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-right image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
			<div class="content" align="justify">
			<p>An other reason could be that countries experience rapid economic growth (country from emerging market economies) requires more crude oil to transport goods or to provide services. In China or in India, people change their eating habits because they have higher incomes which allow them to afford more nutritious diets, increasing their demand for agricultural products, like corn, wheat or soybeans an increasing demand for food, especially for livestock products, which generated increased cereal and oilseed demand to feed the cattle [<a href="#ref:Correlation">6</a>].</p>
			<p>Last solution could be the increase in the popularity of biofuels. They’re made from maize for example for the ethanol. Record oil prices and environmental concerns strengthened the interest in finding alternative energy sources. A list of policy measures in the United States of America and the European Union (EU) encouraged the expansion of biofuel production [<a href="#ref:biofuels">7</a>]. </p>

			<p>This map illustrates perfectly the wheat market. In red are shown the countries that import more wheat or flour than they export and in green the ones that export more.For the poor in developing countries, food can account for at least 50 percent and up to 70–80 percent of their budget. Thus, higher prices affect not only their food consumption in terms of quantity and quality, but also their spending in general. The most visible indicator of this negative impact was the social unrest and rioting that erupted around the world triggered by soaring food prices. Many of the poorest countries are food importers, heavily dependent on cereal imports. Higher food prices on world markets mean higher food import bills and a balance of payments problem</p>

Australia, Canada, France, Russia, Ukraine and the United States of America are the ones who export wheat the much. Algeria, Brazil, Egypt Spain and Italy are the biggest importers.</p>
			<p>The general overview of a wheat market is the following : few countries with high yield, high production area flood the world with wheat. The wheat is mostly manufactured and transformed inside the countries it’s imported. Only Turkey imports significant amount of wheat and re-exports flour. Looking at China and India, their cereals import have been going downwards since 1980, by about 4 percent per year. In the early 1980 they were importing on average about 14 million tonnes per year to roughly 6 million at the beginning of this decade[<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>]. This means that the growth in cereals demand in these two countries has been met mainly from domestic sources.  </p>

				<p>Brazil and Vietnam are the two biggest exporters and producers of coffee in 2016.</p>
				<p>The enclosed plot illustrates the export vs. import quantity traded in 2016 for the 50 biggest “players” in the coffee market. (Note that here we haven’t scaled down taking into account the country’s population, because we are interested in the main actors globally.)</p>

				<p>The two biggest exporters of green coffee beans are Brazil and Vietnam (respoectively exporting more than 1.9M and 1.5M tonnes in 2016).

				<h3>Coffee value</h3>
				<p>Why would Germany play with coffee importation vs. exportation ? Probably because it is a profitable market ! Let’s see the value of the importation vs exportation for these top 50 countries.</p>
				<p>The plot on the right shows the import vs export value (in USD $1’000) in 2016 for the top 50 “players” in the coffee market.</p>

				<p>From our “value per quantity” measure, Germany imports green coffee beans at an average price of 2.611443 (USD$/kg) and exports it back for an average price of 2.776090 (USD$/kg), thus earning USD $0,164647 per kilogram of sold green coffee beans and approximately USD $ 55’157’000 in 2016 ! (as they export 335K tonnes for green coffee beans). This confirms our hypothesis of “profitable market”. </p> 

				<p>Actually Germany is not the only country that takes advantage from trading coffee ! We can see other countries standing out : Belgium, Italy, Switzerland for example.
				<p>Belgium earns money mainly from exportation of roasted coffee and green coffee beans. Yet, like Germany, it is not a coffee-producing country. Thus Belgium xxx TODO</p>

				<p>As explained earlier, and as you can see in the “Worldwide Production in 2016” plot, tobacco, as a product has a high value per quantity, and is widely produced. <br/>
				Mostly used for smoking, tobacco is sold under the form of cigarettes all over the world. The size of the cigarette market can be explained by the highly addictive nature of nicotine found in tobacco leaves. <br/>
				Ignoring the (weird) products cigarettes contain, and focusing on the tobacco plant, we will show the journey of the tobacco, and illustrates the countries that profit from the highly fruitful and controversial business of cigarettes. </p>

				<h3>Top tobacco producers</h3>
				<p>Looking at the production of tobacco over time for the top 5 producers of tobacco of 2016, we clearly see that China is a main player in the tobacco production. <br/>The worldwide tobacco production peaked in 1997, where it was 2.5 times higher than in 1961. <br/>Taking out China of the equation, and the peak worldwide production is in 1993, where it was 1.5 times higher than in 1961. </p> <p>We thus expect China to be the main source of tobacco in the world.</p>

				<p>In the map, we highlighted the main actors in the tobacco/cigarettes trade business, in 2016.  <br/>From the map, we can derive some conclusions:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Tobacco is not exclusively exported by big producers. Some european countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands use it as a trade commodity: they import it cheap to sell them at a higher price: Russia, France, Paraguay, South Africa… Brazil is the number one exporter, not China as we expected. <strong>It turns out that the Chinese people seems to smoke most of its tobacco!</strong> </li>
				<li>The main importers of tobacco unmanufactured are, as expected, the European countries that export but don’t produce (Germany, Belgium), but also Russia, one the number one importer of tobacco. <strong>China also imports tobacco, they really love tobacco! </strong></li>
				<li>Most of the main importers use tobacco as a way to <strong>manufacture cigarettes</strong>. We see that Germany and Netherlands not only trade unmanufactured tobacco, but also are the main exporters of cigarettes.</li>
				<li>The main cigarettes importers are sometimes <strong>surprising</strong>: Australia is still a main importer, <a href="https://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2017/appendix-ix/en/">even with the strong taxes on cigarettes</a>. China, who we expected to have enough cigarettes, is still one of the main importers! As well Germany and Netherlands are also big cigarettes importers. They deal with tobacco at all fronts.</li>

				<p>As shown in the plot on the right, we can see a good “business model”: you import tobacco cheaply, and you export cigarettes with a huge profit (remember the high value per quantity). <br/>Germany follows this model and is the country with the highest gross profit in terms of import/export of tobacco related trades. The big producers of tobacco thus make most of their money exporting it, or making cigarettes and exporting them. </p> 
				<p> Strangely China is part of the countries losing the most money dealing with international tobacco trades. This is explained by the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Tobacco_Corporation">CNTC: China National Tobacco Corporation</a>, a state-owned manufacturer of tobacco products that has the monopoly of the market in China. 
				<p><strong>China is the n°1 consumer of cigarettes (roughly 40% of the world’s consumption), explaining the tobacco/cigarettes concentration around this country.</strong> </p>

				<p>Palm oil is produced in countries which are less economically developed than the countries where the products containing it are sold. This often means the the main producers (Indonesia, Myanmar, ...) have less strict and enforced

				<p>In terms of sugar, the problem is quite different in Swizerland and North America.</p>

					Switzerland is the world biggest chocolate consumer, according to

						Forbes</a>: 11.6 kg per year per capita, roughly 15-20% of the sugar consumed yearly.
					In Swizerland, chocolate represents the large majority of the sugar in our manufactured snacks.
					This is due to some popular companies such as Lindt or Nestlé, who contributed to the design of today's chocolate.
				</p>
				<p>
					In North America, the sugary snacks are more various:
					surprisingly, popcorn is the most common sweetened product!
					Chocolate is also very present, but other examples include biscuits and candies.
					In average those snacks contain less sugar than those in Switzerland.
				</p>

				<p>From the perspective of the Open Food Facts dataset,
					sugary snacks is probably not the reason why people in the US consume more sugar.
					The main reason is rather that most of their casual groceries contains more sugar.
