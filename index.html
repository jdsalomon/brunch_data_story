				<h1>The journey behind a typical hipster sunday hangover brunch</h1>
				<p>Imagine sitting on the terrace of a Parisian café on Sunday morning before ending the weekend and going back to work, a coffee with a cigarette and a avocado toast in hand <em> - typical hipster routine </em>. <br /> Does your Arabica coffee come directly from Brazil ? Why is it that avocado toasts can be found anywhere now, compared to last decade ? Has the cost of the flour of your bread always been the same ? Where do you think your cigarette has been produced ?
					</p>
				<p>The difficulty of knowing the actual story behind what we consume is the topic that interests us. We will show how factors such as globalization, economical and ecological crises, or social tendancies can indirectly influence the products we consume and their price, by focusing on four crops : wheat, avocados, coffee and tobacco.

				<h1>Why these four products ?</h1>

				<p>One can see that the production of most crops parent categories increased from the 1960’ until now. This trend was clearly expected because the population has increased as well. In 1961 there was 3’091 million human beings and in 2016 the number has doubled to reach 7’464 mio [<a href="#ref:WorldPop">1</a>]. </p>
				<p>We can observe that an increase in the world population requires a higher food production in order to satisfy some requirements. Generally in many populations we’ve seen the income increasing and many people left the poverty state. According to the world bank, nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme proverty (live with less than 1.9$ a day) in 2015 than in 1990 [<a href="#ref:Poverty">2</a>]. With the increasing income, the diets will generally change, people will prefer high-value foods (such as livestock products) as opposed to starchy food (such as wheat). So the world production is facing two challenges : producing in quantities that was never bigger and continuously adapt to produce the right kind of crops. </p>

				<p>This graphs illustrates how the demand for crops changed over time. Most of the categories such as coffee, cocoa, and raw materials, rubber for example increased far more than the world population or cereals. Also, except tobacco and vegetable textile fibers, the relative increase in the production of other crops was greater than the increase in the world population.</p>
				<p>Rubber is a raw materials used in the manufacturing of many derived products, the most known being tyres. With 127 million vehicles on the world in 1960 and 1322 mio in 2016, natural increase in the demand for rubber [<a href = "#ref:MotorVeihcle">3</a>].</p>
				<P>Hence the demand for agricultural raw materials such as rubber can be related to economic growth. The adavanced in fertilizers, transportation or refregiration of vegetables or fruits totally change the way people consume food or food was available 60 years ago is not the same as today. It was difficult even unconceivable to eat tomatoes in winter in Sweden after you went out to hunt for the northern lights (another typical hipster activity).  </p>

					<ul>
						<li>The cereals are cheap and produced and lot, the same for Cassava or Potatoes for the vegetables;</li>

				<p>Tobacco is the most expensive product of interest and he’s as produced as the Coffee and Avocados. On the other hand wheat is much more produced and an order of magnitude cheaper than the other crops of interest.

			<p class="align-left">The price evolution for the wheat : </p>
			<p>Import VPQ more bigger than export VPQ, so it’s more expensive in average to buy wheat than to sell it. Since 1961, we notice that it’s price fluctuated a lot and over two periods the price of this commodity increased a lot (1973-1974 and 2007-2008). </p>
			<ul>
				<li>In 1972, bad weather hit the world and for the first time 20 years world food production dropped. The production was reduced by 33 million tonnes where the world required an extra 24 million tonnes to meet the needs of a rapidly rising population [<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>]. </li>
				<li>Two years later in 1974, the world really needed the forecasted abundant harvests in richer nations in order to refill the stocks. But bad luck hit again and Canada, the USA, the former USSR and much of Asia gathered poor crops in that year because of bad weather again. Catastrophe, at the end of the year, world cereal reserves reached a 22-year low and to make it worse, the USA government banned the exportation of 10 million tonnes of grains [<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>] . All of these made the prices skyrocked.</li>

			<p>In the meantime, the agricultural sector has witnessed great technological advances improving the productivity of the workers and reducing the cost of growing crops. The way crops are grown changed also, farmers will try to grow crops which he can sell for the highest price to get more benefits. For example, if maize sell to higher prices on the market then producers will tend to grow more maize at the expense of other crops. Hence the supply will be reduced and their price raised. Increasing demand for livestock products requires to grow more food for them which will increase the demand and prices for cereals and oilseeds.</p>

			<p>Wheat prices have encountered many peaks (1973-1974, 1980-1981) and more recently (2008 and 2011-2013) Which make us think what other commodity had peaks in 1973, 1980, 2008 and 2012 because of wars or financial crises. You have it : Petrol !! </p>
			<p>The pearson correlation coefficient between this commodity and wheat is quite significant : 0.908 and 0.906 for respectively the wheat export and import value per quantity. </p>
			<p>One can thing of many reasons which can explain the correlation between wheat and petrol.Fertilizers and chemical products are basically made of oil derivatives and they’re used to grow wheat for instance. If oil is expensive then wheat will also be expensive to produce. This factor is amplified because many developing countries also import oil. So if the oil is more expensive then they’re left with less to buy the chemicals and nutrients that requires their high-yield intensive farming.</p>

			<div class="content" align="justify">
			<p>An other reason could be that countries experience rapid economic growth (country from emerging market economies) requires more crude oil to transport goods or to provide services. In China or in India, people change their eating habits because they have higher incomes which allow them to afford more nutritious diets, increasing their demand for agricultural products, like corn, wheat or soybeans an increasing demand for food, especially for livestock products, which generated increased cereal and oilseed demand to feed the cattle [<a href="#ref:Correlation">6</a>].</p>
			<p>Last solution could be the increase in the popularity of biofuels. They’re made from maize for example for the ethanol. Record oil prices and environmental concerns strengthened the interest in finding alternative energy sources. A list of policy measures in the United States of America and the European Union (EU) encouraged the expansion of biofuel production [<a href="#ref:biofuels">7</a>]. </p>

			<p>This map illustrates perfectly the wheat market. In red are shown the countries that import more wheat or flour than they export and in green the ones that export more.For the poor in developing countries, food can account for at least 50 percent and up to 70–80 percent of their budget. Thus, higher prices affect not only their food consumption in terms of quantity and quality, but also their spending in general. The most visible indicator of this negative impact was the social unrest and rioting that erupted around the world triggered by soaring food prices. Many of the poorest countries are food importers, heavily dependent on cereal imports. Higher food prices on world markets mean higher food import bills and a balance of payments problem</p>

			<p>Let’s have a look at the big names in the wheat market. From which country the flour in your bread is most likely to come from ? Australia, Canada, France, Russia, Ukraine and the United States of America are the ones who export wheat the much. Algeria, Brazil, Egypt Spain and Italy are the biggest importers.</p>
			<p>The general overview of a wheat market is the following : few countries with high yield, high production area flood the world with wheat. The wheat is mostly manufactured and transformed inside the countries it’s imported. Only Turkey imports significant amount of wheat and re-exports flour. Looking at China and India, their cereals import have been going downwards since 1980, by about 4 percent per year. In the early 1980 they were importing on average about 14 million tonnes per year to roughly 6 million at the beginning of this decade[<a href="#ref:Wheat">5</a>]. This means that the growth in cereals demand in these two countries has been met mainly from domestic sources.  </p>

					<p align="justify"> It depends a lot. The sugar contained in fruits is very different from the sugar contained in soft drinks.
						A simplification is to define <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_sugars"> free sugars</a> as the bad kind of sugar.
						The World Health Organisation suggests in <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/sugar-guideline/en/"> a recent article</a>
						not to exceed ~50g of free sugars per day; if possible less than ~25g.
						However, people from almost all modern countries eat in average more sugar than what is recommended.

				<p>Sugary snacks consists of small manufactured items such as biscuits, candies, or chocolate.

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>In terms of sugar, the problem is quite different in Swizerland and North America.</p>
				<p>
					Switzerland is the world biggest chocolate consumer, according to
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_chocolate"> Wikipedia</a>
					or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/07/22/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-consumers-infographic/#3662da084484">
						Forbes</a>: 11.6 kg per year per capita, roughly 15-20% of the sugar consumed yearly.
					In Swizerland, chocolate represents the large majority of the sugar in our manufactured snacks.
					This is due to some popular companies such as Lindt or Nestlé, who contributed to the design of today's chocolate.
				</p>
				<p>
					In North America, the sugary snacks are more various:
					surprisingly, popcorn is the most common sweetened product!
					Chocolate is also very present, but other examples include biscuits and candies.
					In average those snacks contain less sugar than those in Switzerland.
				</p>

				<p>From the perspective of the Open Food Facts dataset,
					sugary snacks is probably not the reason why people in the US consume more sugar.
					The main reason is rather that most of their casual groceries contains more sugar.

				<p>France and the US are the only two countries with more than 300 possible additives in their entries. What happens when countries are ranked by the proportion of dangerous additives? The most commons additives are natural and harmless. Rather than counting all the additives, we will rank the countries based on a recent

				<h3>Additives present in the US but not in France</h3>
				<p>22 additives are present in at least one US product but never appear in France.</p>
				<p>The following are actually foridden in France:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>E105: Fast Yellow AB</li>
					<li>E107: Yellow 2G</li>
					<li>E1504: Ethyl acetate</li>
					<li>E409: Arabinogalactan</li>

					<li>E924a: Potassium bromate</li>
					<li>E927a: Azodicarbonamide</li>
					<li>E928: Benzoyl peroxide</li>
				</ul>
				<p>E924a is particularly interesting as it is a floor leaching agent forbidden in the whole EU but it has been used extensively by big brands such as Subway and Wendy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azodicarbonamide">in the US</a>.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>E161g: Canthaxanthin</li>

					<li>E634: Calcium ribonucleotides</li>
					<li>E905b: Carnauba wax</li>

				<p>The absence of some of these can be easily explained. E161g for exmaple, is only allowed for use in sausages from Strasbourg. This makes it quite rare and explains why it is not in the Open Food Facts database</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p class="align-left">It's interesting to see how differently the US and France are concerning additives. Despite France having a larger variety of additives in the dataset, very few dangerous ones appear in French food.</p>
				<p class="align-left">Looking at the difference between additives available in France and the US, we found that several of these absences could be explained by the fact that France has stricter regulations on additives. HHowever, these additives
					allowed in the US ut not France are only present in 0.4% of products</p>
